# Skill Requirements and Responsibilities

"*Security engineering is about building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance. As a discipline, it focuses on the tools, processes and methods needed to design, implement, and test complete systems, and to adapt existing systems as their environment evolves*" -**Ross Anderson** [^1]

It should be noted that these systems are not limited to computer systems, but rather complete systems involving people and related equipment.

### Description

This file contains some of the more commonly spotted responsibilities, requirements and skills wanted and appreciated in security engineering jobs and related career paths. These can give you some background into the work done in and with security engineering, which in itself is not always the job title, or even the task description; multiple roles in cyber security require security engineering skills and knowledge.

Security engineering as a course is not too technical as the technical side and your technical skills are very cumulative throughout cyber security studies. The below list can also give insight as to why this course focuses more on the less technical side of cyber security; as all of these are very important and can easily be improved upon. Cyber security careers require much more than just the technical skills and offensive mindset. 

This list will not disclose the companies or any other details about the job postings.

## Common Responsibilities

* Collaboration with engineering teams such as infrastructure, development and architecture (integrating security to development lifecycle)  
* Collaboration with customers regarding security and development costs (risk management, justifiable risk)  
* Implementation and management of policies and procedures (security posture, threat modelling)  
* Application, software, infrastructure, etc... assessment to identify vulnerabilities and weak spots (security testing) 
* Maintain incident response plan (collaborative task)   
* Address security concerns from different teams  
* Design and implementation of technical security solutions  
* Creation of quality documentation for different skill levels  
* Auditing and testing code, teams, tools, pipelines, etc...  
* Developing and maintaining DevSecOps  
* Providing recommendations and taking initiatives in corporate security

## Common requirements

* Background in STEM or demonstrable alternative path (usually BSc, MSc or good track record in cyber, networking or software engineering)  
* Experience in cyber security job roles (most commonly around 3 years, not necessarily a hard requirement)  
* Proficient proven writing skills (planning, revising, grammar, clarity, etc.., basic documenting skills)
* Effective and confident communication skills (includes the ability to receive feedback)  
* Understanding of common standards and modern regulations in cyber space (such as OWASP, ISO 27001, NIS2, NIST, etc...)  
* Hands-on experience with a variety of related tools (defensive to offensive, utility(containers, etc...) to infrastructure(cloud platforms, physical access, etc...))  
* Competetent in at least one programming language (languages usually specified)  
* Experience in security and/or penetration testing  
* Problem solving skills
