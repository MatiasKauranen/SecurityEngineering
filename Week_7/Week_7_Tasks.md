## Safety Concerns

## Why are new safety concerns sometimes overlooked?
Vendors often try to blame users for product safety concerns, thus claiming that the issue is 'user error'. Vendors want to deny responsibility for these security concerns to avoid legislative consequences. In the case of infusion pumps, the issue was with different and non-standardized user interfaces that made human mistakes more likely to happen. Having a standardized system would make these accidents less likely to occur. Oftentimes, these large companies have significant political or lobbying power to slow down the process of standardization. After all, these companies would lose a lot of money if they had to change their manufacturing methods or if their inventory in warehouses became obsolete due to being non-standard.

## What are events that trigger sudden change?
Incentives to improve safety are not working; therefore, security scares are the driving force behind sudden changes in security concerns. A security scare in which it was proven that pacemakers could be taken over via the RF channel proved that security scares can bring a lot of attention to safety concerns and lead to quick changes. Overall, progress is still very slow.
