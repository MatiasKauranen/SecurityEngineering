# Task1: Bring your own devices
Following link containing NIST:s security recommendations for workplace bring your own device. On the page 12 is listed following 9 threat events, and your job is to make one A4 sized poster or otherwise shortly summarize what each listed threat event means based on the document or your own research.
## Intrusive application practices
Intrusive application practices refers to application which collects users personal information and data without their knowledge or consent. Criminals often use these kinds of applications to harvest sensitive data for reselling, targeted ads, or other malicious purposes.
## Account credential theft through phishing
Credential phishing is spesific type of phishing which aim is to gain access to victims username and password. Attacker uses phised credentials to gain unauthorized  access to accounts such as email, business resources or other valuable accounts.
## Outdated phones
Outdated phones pose a security threat for multiple reasons: outdated OS, insecure configs, elevation of privileges, unauthorized device profiles and compromised devices. Best way to prevent these kinds of vulnerabilities is to have phone with latest OS and security updates.
## Sensitive data transmissions
Sensitive data should only be transmitted through secure channels. Using unencrypted Wifi or unauthorized apps can pose a security threat via data exposure or interception.
## Brute-force attacks to unlock a phone
Brute-force attack refers to attacker trying to guess password to unlock phone. If password it too short or too easy to guess, attacker may gain access to stolen phone. It's advised to use strong or biometric password to secure your devices.
## Application credential storage vulnerability
This vulnerability refers to situation in which device stores credentials in plain text or other unsecure forms which could potentially be stolen via physical or remote access.
## Unmanaged device protection
Unmanaged device protection refers to security risk in which unmanaged devices have access to company resources. Unmanaged devices usually lack sufficient security measures or tools to protect these valuable resources.
## Lost or stolen data protection
This risk refers to situation in which valuable data is stored on device which can be lost or stolen. These devices therefore have to be secured to prevent potential data loss or leak. This kind of risk can be mitigated for example by using cloud only storage and avoiding storing on local storage.
## Protecting enterprise data from being inadvertently backed up to a cloud service
This risk refers to situation in which sensitive corporate data is unintentionaly uploaded to public or personal cloud. This risks data privacy and violates compliance. Storing on public/personal cloud can also cause data leaks.
